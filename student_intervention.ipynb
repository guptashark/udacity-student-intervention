    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "**industry application: ** It took a bit of binging to find some real-world applications but eventually we banged out some results. Wikipedia provided a lot of information on the mechanics of decision trees but I ended up looking at scholarly works for uses of Decision trees in real life [here](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html). The medical references interested me the most and I followed it to this [pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.109.7119&rep=rep1&type=pdf). The article discusses how decision trees and naive bayes classifiers are used to determine whether a patient has a type of serious illness. The main conclusion regarding decision trees was that though it outperformed physicians in determining the patient's illness, it wasn't very reliable since it only took the most important attributes into account and didn't seem to be very holistic. (Bottom of page 8). \n",
    "\n",
    "**strengths: ** From the essay, I realized (or was rereminded) that decision trees can deal with continuous values while Bayesian classifiers have trouble with continuous variables. Another advantage is that since decision trees can deal with numerical and categorical variables well, we don't need to do to preprocessing that created dummy variables. (But since we have, it seems like Bayes would be a good learner for this dataset). \n",
    "\n",
    "**weaknesses: ** Decision trees can become weak when dealing with things like XOR and other odd booleans (as was shown in some of the instructional videos). The tree can become pretty big when it tries to learn those underlying relationships. Decision trees also struggle with providing reliability with thier decisions. As was shown in the paper, decision trees don't provide anything like confidence intervals. This property also makes them somewhat non-robust, where they may change drastically with slight changes in training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "** good candidate for problem: ** Since the dataset seems to be relatively large (lots of features) and there are some numerical features that I feel would strongly influence whether a student passes (studytime, freetime) this learner is an appropriate fit for the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaboost**\n",
    "\n",
    "**industry application: ** From the course lectures it would seem that spam detection seems like a good use of ensemble methods. When a problem is too hard or complex to understand with just one classifier, it makes sense to use many classifiers. If ensemble methods are used in spam, then it's likely that they're used to learn languages themselves. I had a friend who was working with Natural Language Processing, and that problem came to mind. A quick search shows that people have taken in interest in using ensemble methods to try and learn the many rules of common languages and that ensemble methods show improvement over things like decision trees. A paper on this topic is [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/papers/hlt-emnlp05-art.pdf). We're going to use boosting as our algorithm for combining the learners so that we're training on sections of the data we've had trouble with. Adaboost is a nice goto algorithm because it combines boosting and decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths: ** From the paper a strength seems to be that Adaboost performs well in situations when there are many reasons for determining the output of a classifier. Adaboost can also work well on large datasets because they simply break down the dataset into an arbitrary number of training sets for each of the decistion trees built into the ensemble. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses: ** Adaboost can sometimes overfit. A decision tree may overfit by assigning one datapoint to a leaf node, and as such overfitting the training set. Since adaboost is built with decision trees, the error is likely to carry over. When a training set is broken down, certain attributes might be randomly emphasized and as such the decision trees pick up rules that shouldn't really exist. Our dataset has many features, but relatively few data points. We won't be able to split it into too many training sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "** good candidate for problem: ** Since it seems likely that with 30 or 40 features there could be several combinations of complex rules that could determine if a student passes or fails, I expect Adaboost to be able to be as good as or better than other classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Gaussian Naive Bayes **\n",
    "\n",
    "** industry application: ** Naive Bayes seems to be pretty widespread in industry use. The reason for this is that it scales linearly with the number of features that are used to classify the output variable. For this reason, it can be used as a method that has some reliability in situations with many features, such as medical diagnosis. (Referenced from wikipedia and the paper linked when discussing decision trees). \n",
    "\n",
    "**strengths** Bayes provides some kind of reliability and stability when determining an output. Since each feature is weighed independently against the output, we can take into account how important each feature is in determining what the output should be, and how reliable that feature is when predicting the output. Since the learner scales linearly with the number of features, it manages large datasets relatively quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**weaknesses** Bayes makes a strong assumption: the input features are all independent. This could break the classification and hence this is why it's a \"naive\" classifier. Another issue is that the classifier tends to \"bin\" continuous variables into binary categories. This could throw out much information that would be used in the classificiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**good candidate for problem: ** The main arguing point is that bayes is robust and works in linear time to learn the dataset. This is a huge selling point, even if it means lower accuracy. Since the data has already been preprocessed to break up the categorical variables into dummy variables, the data is poised for use with a bayes classifier. "

    "**Answer: ** The main goal of the learner is to solve the problem of estimating whether a student will fail or not. Using the given data the model determines probabilities associated with each feature and whether the student passes or fails. Features are the data we collect about each student, whether they have a job, internet, are in a relationship, etc. The model precomputes probabilities of the form: \"The student has internet, given that he or she passed\" and \"The student does not have internet, given that he or she passed.\" and also \"The student has internet, given that he or she failed\" and \"The student does not have internet, given he or she failed\". This is the process of training the learner. Once all of these probabilities are computed for each feature, we can make a prediction. If we want to know whether a student is expected to pass or fail with a given set of features, we can compute the probability that he or she will pass and the probability that he or she will fail using the precomputed probabilities for each feature. Once that is done, we take whichever number is higher, and then classify the student as pass or fail. \n",

The DecisionTreeClassifier has many more interesting parameters and it seemed like a good idea to try some manual pruning to see which tree depth gave the best f1 scores. The reason it made sense to prune the DecisionTree is that during the training phase, it would overfit and match the training data perfectly but then suffer consequently on the testing data. Some pruning helped the f1 score on the testing set which what we're looking for and brought the training f1 score close to the testing f1 score. This consistency shows that we're neither overfitting or underfitting. The untuned tree overfit, while the tuned tree doesn't. We see an f1 score gain of about 5 percent. (roughly 83 - 78). "
